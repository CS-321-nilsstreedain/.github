# Introduction to Theory of Computation
Welcome to CS321, where we learn about:
- the limits of computation: what computers can and cannot do
- what makes certain problems impossible for computers to solve
- how to communicate formally and precisely about abstract computation and algorithmic processes

## Course info
- **Meeting**: Mon/Wed/Fri 9:00-9:50am, FURM (Furman Hall) 102
- **Instructor**: Jiayu Xu, xujiay@oregonstate.edu, KEC (Kelley Engineering Center) 3049
  - office hours: Wed 1:00-2:00pm
- **TA**: David Richardson, richdavi@oregonstate.edu, KEC main lobby
  - office hours: Tue 1:00-2:00pm
- **TA**: William Solow, soloww@oregonstate.edu, KEC main lobby
  - office hours: Thu 1:00-2:00pm

## Textbook
None, reference book: https://sarielhp.org/teach/notes/373/book.pdf Links to an external site. (contains much more materials than what we will cover)

## Course assessments
### Homework assignments
60% (there will be 5 of them, and lowest score will be dropped, so each homework assignment is 15%)

### Final exam
40% (no mid-term exam)

Final exam will be on 12/12 at 6:00pm; see https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/final-examination-schedule

## Policy on collaboration and use of generative AI
Everything you write for this course must reflect your personal understanding of the material. Submissions from different students should never look similar. Use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT is allowed, provided that you understand everything in your homework submission.

## Accommodations for disability
Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at http://ds.oregonstate.edu. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations.

## Tentative lecture schedule
Classes begin on 09/27 and ends on 12/08 (see https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/osu-academic-calendar); no class on 11/10 and 11/24 (see https://registrar.oregonstate.edu/simple-tab/holidays-closures-0). As such, there will be 30 lectures in total. I only listed the schedule for 29 lectures below (starting from 0th); this will allow us to go slower than expected, or cancel a class, or cover some more advanced materials.

Lecture slides will be posted (in .pptx form) on "Files" page before or shortly after corresponding lectures.
